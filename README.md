# The PHP Crude CRUD App

## Demonstrates a basic Dynamic HTML Application using PHP

It doesn't get much more crude than this, but is a great starting point for understanding how **dynamic data-driven web applications** work.

Understand how this one works, and more modern/advanced/complex web development frameworks, won't seem so mysterious.

This application assumes the MySQL database has certain users added and an "employees" database based on a sample dataset from "data charmer"

Look for my Git Repo for Vagrant Automation for the PHP Crude CRUD app that automates the creation of a LAMP server right on your laptop/desktop.

The "credentials.php" file above has the details of the MySQL database connection.

Obviously everything is in the open and unsecure here.  This app assumes that the database is on the same server as the Apache/PHP server.

If it isn't, you'll need to update the credentials file and change "localhost" to whatever the IP address is of your database.

...and obviously change the credentials too...
